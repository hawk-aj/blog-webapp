# Jupyter Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data science work and analysis.

## Getting Started

When you run the Docker deployment, Jupyter will be available at:
- Local development: http://localhost:8888
- AWS deployment: https://yourdomain.com/jupyter

## Notebook Organization

Organize your notebooks in the following structure:

```
notebooks/
├── data-analysis/          # Data analysis notebooks
├── machine-learning/       # ML model development
├── research/              # Research and experimentation
├── tutorials/             # Learning and tutorial notebooks
└── utils/                 # Utility functions and helpers
```

## Sample Notebooks

Create notebooks for:
- Portfolio data analysis
- Recommendation system development
- Speaker diarization research
- AWS data processing workflows

## Tips

1. **Version Control**: Consider using `.ipynb_checkpoints/` in `.gitignore`
2. **Data Files**: Store large data files outside the repository
3. **Environment**: The Jupyter container includes common data science libraries
4. **Sharing**: Export notebooks to HTML/PDF for sharing

## Security Note

In production deployment, consider adding authentication to Jupyter for security.
